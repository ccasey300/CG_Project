\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

If I was to revisit this project, there are quite a few improvements I would make. The biggest being previously mentioned OOP.

I would focus on technical implementations at an early and revise my attempts to debug. Inclusion of modular programming would likely make the project's completion far more effective. Rather than building all of the objects in the scene, implementing a skybox, etc., I would focus on one object and ensure I can get lighting and shadows to work. .cpp became too cluttered and I was pigeon-holed. 

I struggled to implement an infinite scene also. I tried using a chunking method, clamping the camera and actively rendering the environment based on user input but wasn't successful. 

Lighting and animation I found particularly difficult to integrate into my existing template. I believe my shader logic for shadows was at least partially incorrect, (see screenshot). I was disappointed to not be able to include animation succinctly in my scene, though the MP4 video shows my attempt. We can see the skeleton running as required in the previous lab 4. Debugging attempts included focusing on OpenGL parameters redefinitions and resetting these. Debugging attempts were unsuccessful and could not get A) the city scape with skybox and textures and B) skeleton running on screen. 

Overall, I struggled most with combining different techniques in my code. This was a symptom of poor decisions early on. We can see that some valid attempts were made (lighting, animation), but were not ready in time for the deadline.
