- Modify the cube buffers so that the inner surfaces of the cube becomes front facing in
counter-clockwise order.
- Set the UV coordinates properly for each face to map to the +X, -X, +Z, -Z, +Y, -Y region in
the texture. Make use of the debug textures.
- Set the texture parameters properly to remove any seams appeared in the rendering.
Consider setting GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T,
GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, and GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILT
